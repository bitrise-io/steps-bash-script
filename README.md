steps-bash-script
=================

Saves it's input as a bash file and runs it. Roll your own, custom bash scripts with this Bitrise Step!


## Input:
- `__INPUT_FILE__` containing the content of the script


## Notes:
- `__INPUT_FILE__` is a special Bitrise input. Bitrise will write the value into a file and provide the file's path for the Step instead of providing the value directly.
